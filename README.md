# Minimum Working Examples

Repository that contains code to Minimum Working Examples of libraries, technologies, hardware cards, algorithms, AI models, etc.

Most of those examples will probably end up in being just application on tutorial found on the web, but they will also indicate all the little things that make those tutorials works (connection procedure of specific hardware board, init of the board, version of libraries, etc.)

Each subfolder contains a README with links and info to make the example works.
